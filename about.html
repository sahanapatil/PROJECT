    <p> <B><h1><u>This model helps to handle Missing Data</u></h1></B></br>
      <h2>Whenever a Dataset is given it is pretty sure that there will be some <b>missing data in it.</b></br>
       <h3> some <b>Algorithms</b> can handle missing data and execute,but for some algorithms the missed data has to be handled and then the data set has to be passed.</h3>
<h2> In this model 3 methods have been used to handle missing data</h2>
<h3><b><u></u>1)RMV <BR> 2)IMPUTE<BR> 3)MLM</b></h3>
  <h2><b><u>Details</u></b></h2>
  <h3>1)<u><b>RMV:</b></u>REMOVING MISSING VALUE<br>
        Remove the missing value <br>
      <br>
<B>  <u> Advantages:</u></B><br>
         Can use complete case analysis methods<br><br>
         <u> Disadvantages: </u><br>
         Reduces variability<br>
         Weakens covariance and correlation estimates in the data (because 
       ignores relationship between variables)                  <br><br>
    2)<b></b><u>IMPUTE:</u></b> In statistics, imputation is the process of replacing missing data with substituted values.  <br>
              Because missing data can create problems for analyzing data, <br>
              imputation is seen as a way to avoid pitfalls involved with listwise deletion of cases that have missing values.  <br>                   <BR>
    3)<b></b><u>MLM :</u> </b>In this method, missing values are not replaced or imputed, <br>
                but the missing data is handled within the analysis model. <br>
                The model is estimated by a full information maximum likelihood method, <br>
                that way all available information is used to estimate the model.                 <BR></h3>
<b>ABOUT DATASET</b><BR>
  There are 768 observations with 8 input variables and 1 output variable. The variable names are as follows:<BR>

0. Number of times pregnant.<br>
1. Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test..<br>
2. Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)..<br>
3. Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)..<br>
4. 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)..<br>
5. Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)..<br>
6. Diabetes pedigree function..<br>
7. Age (years)..<br>
8. Class variable (0 or 1)..<br>
